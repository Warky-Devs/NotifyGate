# NotifyGate

## Project Overview
A centralized notification hub that receives webhooks and distributes notifications across multiple providers with user-configurable preferences, scheduling, and channel management.


Channels → Destinations (where notifications are delivered)
Providers → Endpoints (how notifications are sent)
Notifications → Travelers (the messages passing through the gate)
